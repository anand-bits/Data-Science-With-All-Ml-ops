# ML Model Version Control with MLflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of MLflow for model version control in a machine learning (ML) project. The project includes preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using logistic regression.

## Features
- MLflow integration for model versioning and experiment tracking.
- Preprocessing using visualization techniques.
- Logistic regression model training and evaluation.
- Auto-logging with MLflow for seamless experiment tracking.

## Model Performance
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 79%, making it one of the best-performing models in the project.

## Preprocessing
Data preprocessing was performed using visualization techniques to gain insights into the data and make informed decisions about feature engineering and selection.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- MLflow
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
